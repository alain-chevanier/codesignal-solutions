## Check the full description and test cases visiting link above

For the given number ```n``` we define its indicator ```I(n)``` as the smallest integer ```k >= 1```, such that ```k!``` is divisible by ```n```.

Given ```n```, calculate its indicator.

__Example__

For ```n = 10```, the output should be ```Indicator(n) = 5```.

```5! = 120```, which is divisible by ```10```.

__Input/Output__

* __[execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (cpp)__

* __[input]__ integer ```n```

    Constraints: ```1 <= n <= 2 ^ 109.```

 * __[output]__ integer
 
    Indicator of ```n```.
